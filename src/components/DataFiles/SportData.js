    body: "Real Madrid's, Karim Benzema was on Monday night announced as the winner of this year's Ballon d'Or award. The Frenchman admitted his career hasn't always been easy after winning the prize for the first time. Benzema also became the oldest player ever at 34 to win the Ballon d'Or. 'I always had this dream in my mind that everything's possible. 'There was a difficult period where I wasn't in the French team but I worked hard and never gave up, kept my head down and enjoyed playing football. 'People play until their later years now and I still have this burning desire. 'It is this drive that has kept me going and never allowed me to let up. I just want to make the most of it,' Benzema said. Benzema netted 44 times in 46 appearances as Los Blancos lifted both the LaLiga title and Champions League trophy.",

    body: "Roma manager, Jose Mourinho has claimed Karim Benzema did not win the Ballon d'Or award all these years, because he is 'obsessed with his team'. The Real Madrid captain was announced the winner of this year's prize at 34 years. Benzema led Los Blancos to LaLiga and the Champions League glory. Mourinho managed Benzema during his three years at the Santiago Bernabeu, when Cristiano Ronaldo was the team's main man. It was only after Ronaldo left that Benzema assumed the mantle of being Madrid's leading light. 'Karim is a great character, great personality, and a team guy. 'He is not obsessed with himself, he is not obsessed with the Ballon d'Or, he is not a guy obsessed with scoring more goals than A, B or C. 'He is just a team guy who does a lot in a way that the Ballon d'Or becomes a natural consequence. I think he is a guy obsessed with his team,' Mourinho said in a recorded tribute.",

    body: "Manchester United's former striker, Louis Saha has told manager, Erik ten Hag he is 'disrespecting' Cristiano Ronaldo at the club. This was after the veteran forward was replaced during United's Sunday's game against Newcastle United. Ronaldo led the line for the Red Devils at Old Trafford and after seeing two efforts ruled out, the Portuguese was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 18 minutes left on the clock. He was muttering and shaking his head in irritation as he left the pitch and Saha questioned ten Hag's decision to pull out a known goal getter, insisting there is no one better than him when you are under pressure to score. Saha is convinced the former Real Madrid star has not declined in any way, adding there is 'no indication' he is slowing down. 'Ronaldo has been disrespected,' Saha told Boyle Sports. 'I have not fully agreed with the management of Ten Hag. 'I can understand why Ronaldo was upset after the Newcastle game because he trusts himself to score, lately, he has not been as lucky and efficient, it happens, and people need to realise he is not a robot. 'When people are tired, Ronaldo is a killer, there is no one better than him when you are under pressure to score important goals, he did it last year and there is no reason for him not to continue that this season. 'I have not seen any indication physically that shows he's slowing down.'",

The 34-year-old added: 'From the first minutes, I see that with my team-mates we have big potential and I have the opportunity to score a lot of goals.

Liverpool defeated Man City, thanks to Mohamed Salah's second-half goal as Phil Foden's goal was disallowed by the referee during the tie. However, Silva was visibly irked about Foden's disallowed goal during his post-match interview. Speaking to Sky Sports, the Portugal international said: 'What we expect from the referees is consistency in the decisions. When you go through a path of not whistling little contacts throughout the whole game, you need to keep those decisions and keep going that way. If you want to whistle all of them, whistle all of them.' But in a tweet via his Twitter handle, Enrique labelled Silva as an idiot player, adding that he doesn't know how to lose. He tweeted, 'Bernardo Silva is one of the most idiots players in the game, seriously. He doesn't know how to lose.'",

Earlier on in the match, Martinez ignored a similar penalty claim from Robert Lewandowski. Laporta was unhappy with the officials and confronted them directly post-match. The referee's match report revealed that the Barca president came into their dressing room and 'repeatedly requesting explanations about some situations in the match'. Laporta was then 'invited to leave without further incident'.",

Ten Hag made just one change which was taking off Ronaldo fo Rashford as United chased the winner. The former Ajax boss was asked why he opted for just one sub, and he told reporters, 'Exactly. Some players were not available, as you know, today. Christian Eriksen not available, Anthony Martial not available, Scott McTominay not available. 'So that was the feeling I had. I brought freshness with Rashy, I think he had an impact. If he scored that goal then you do everything right.' It was Manchester United's first draw of the season, having lost three Premier League matches and won six before today. The Red Devils heaviest defeat came in the hands of Brentford and Manchester City earlier in the season.",
