Reports gathered that she had come to the lounge with a man but was abandoned unexpectedly and she didn't have enough to pay the bill. She resorted to begging the staff to consider her since they are all females but her please fell on deaf ears. The staff didn't take it lightly as they threatened to assault her if she didn't settle them on time. One of them said:- 'You no know say you go pay when you dey chop all this one?. Dem dey follow you talk small small, you dey raise voice. Oga pay your bill!' Reacting to the outburst, the other lady pleaded that they tamper justice with mercy and stop embarrassing her. 'Can you guys just relax? Don't touch me, wait make I pay my bills. Stop embarrassing me', the heartbroken lady replied.",

    body: "Heartbroken man recounts how he found out that his newly married wife had slept with six men at NYSC camp and did abortion twice for one. According to the narrator, his fianc√©e who had gone for NYSC failed to redeploy over complicated issues. Due to distance, his father-in-law had advise them to get engaged; since he just got a job recently, he decided to take a loan to do the necessary introductions and court wedding. After her service year, she returned but with a more withdrawn attitude; she rarely talked much and when he asked her about it, she had told him she lost a friend. The man revealed that he had taken it upon himself to do the house chores so she has time to rest. He stated that his mother-in-law had called to give them a prayer point to pray with and since it wasn't on his phone, he had checked his wife's WhatsApp only to find messages from a certain Niyi. The heartbroken man revealed that his wife had been corresponding with the guy and they had been planning to elope together. When he confronted his wife about it, she flared up and began demanding why he would check her phone. She, however, confessed that she had slept with six men at the NYSC camp and had done abortions for her lover, Niyi. Read his narration below: - 'Good morning. My girlfriend went to serve last year and she was supposed to redeploy back to our base but it didn't work. Because of the distance her father advised us to get engaged. Despite the fact that I! just got a job, I applied for loan and it was granted. We were able to do introduction and court wedding. So she was wearing her rings but she still wasn't deployed. During the 1 year service she comes home and I go visit her. She just finished serving a couple of weeks ago. I made sure our house got a new look as we were looking forward to our wedding by August next year. I notice my wife is always sad and disconnected. So I kept asking her what was wrong and she said she lost a friend. I started doing everything at home before I go to work so she can rest n- buy her small things evervday so she could be happy. It didn't stop the dulliness. Her mum called last night and while greeting me, she said she sent some prayers to our whatsapp that we should pray with it. By the time I remembered, my wife was sleeping. So I decided to pray alone, I checked my whatsapp for her mums message and it wasn't there so I checked hers. That was when I saw the chats from one Niyi guy that she has been going out with in camp and she aborted 2ce for. They are even planning on running away togethe. Till now my body is still shaking. I confronted her and she started shouting about why I was checking her phone, started cussing and after so much argument, she confessed she had slept with 6 guys in camp and she met the Niyi at her ppa that's why she didn't want to redeploy. I'm so sad and heartbroken. I can't go to work. I have been crying. I loved her so much. I don't know if I can ever forgive her. Please advise me. What should I do? Please Conceal my identity.'",

    body: "Young lady reveals that her prideful boyfriend terminated their relationship because she got him an Apple MacBook. According to the lady identified as Uzo Njoku, she had decided to gift her man a new MacBook. Much to her disappointment, her boyfriend didn't receive it excitedly; rather, he told her that he had been saving up to get it for himself. He had, according to Uzo, stated that although things are tight for him, he wouldn't let her buy things for him until they were equal in terms of spending; hurt by this, she noted that she had learned to only get expensive gifts for her future husband. Uzo further added that she's now happily single and doesn't have to put up with being told she's too ambitious. See wrote:- 'I bought this man a MacBook and that was what sparked the downfall of our relationship. M nare so competitive and prideful omg. Lesson learned to not buy them expensive gifts unless it's my husband. Happily single. Tired of hearing I'm too ambitious He was visibly upset about the gift saying he was going to buy it next year after saving. I offered to return it, he said nah. Money was tight for him but he wouldn't let me buy anything moving forward until we were equal in terms of spending. No dates. Just staring at the wall Then he began to police my spending. Telling me to return my Gucci glasses, I can buy Amazon glasses. I wanted to go to Cancun and he kept downing it saying no let's vacation at North Carolina. I'm sorry wtf is there. I paid for our trip to Cancun and hell broke loose. There are plenty of great women out to say he fumbled. Economics does pay a huge factor in relationships and I hope he finds someone more up his speed. I've learned to not buy a man something he can't afford'",

However, after finding out she owns the house, he cut ties with her and advised her to get a room apartment instead. In her words: - 'I never forgot (this was years ago) when this guy found out that I owned the house I lived in, I never heard from him again. My friend said you shouldn't have told him.

    body: "Former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka, is bereaved as he lost his brother-in-law on Saturday, October 15. In a post shared on social media, Chidoka revealed that his brother-in-law had visited the Federal Medical Center in Jabi on Friday, October 14, to complain of chest pain, but was allegedly asked to return on Saturday, October 1 as the lab technicians who were to carry out a test on him had closed for the day. Sadly, he suffered a cardiac arrest the next day and was rushed to the same hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Read his account of what transpired below. 'Yesterday, I wrote about the inevitability of death as we approach the fifth decade conscious of the fact that the life expectancy of a Nigerian is 54 years. Today death visited. My brother-in-law Apost Paul Egbon husband of my only sister Ada Chidoka Egbon died at age 56. Yesterday, he was at the Federal Medical Centre Jabi with a complaint of chest pain. The Doctor who saw him prescribed painkillers and recommended ECG and other tests. At the Lab, they said it was late in the day and asked them to come back today Saturday. He walked to the car and they drove home. Allowing him to go home was a questionable decision. I couldn't help but recall, when as a grad student, I walked into Arlington, VA General Hospital with a chest pain complaint. They brought a stretcher immediately and took me to emergency. They ran all the tests and held me fastened to the bed until all the results came and they concluded it was a chest muscle pain. Early hours of this morning about 5 am he suffered, what we suspect, to be a cardiac arrest. My sister rushed him to the same federal Medical Centre Jabi. A doctor came out saw him in the car and pronounced him dead. They gave her a form and told her to take him to the mortuary. Yes, you read right. They told a grieving woman, who was told without any preparation, to take her dead husband to the morgue. They did not remove the corpse from the car. Apparently, there is no protocol to receive a patient brought in dead. She was in the car with her dead husband when my Uncle, a medical doctor, arrived. I arrived shortly after. She was in the car crying holding her husband in the car park of the hospital. A hospital they have used for years. We struggled to get her out of the car before we moved the corpse to the morgue. The hospital did not receive the body formally. No attempt at separating a wife from a corpse. No official record of the review that pronounced him dead. They did not counsel her or even empathise with her. It was not a medical failure; wrong diagnosis or lack of treatment. It was a process and cultural failure. Something has gone wrong with our humanity and sense of empathy as a people. I advise, go for regular medical checkups. Have a primary health physician who knows you personally and has your history. Your primary physician is likely to be the difference between life and death. Our institutions are weak and our public servants are neither public-minded nor interested in service. Together with the departed, we pray for God's mercy and love upon us all. Amen. Osita Chidoka'",
