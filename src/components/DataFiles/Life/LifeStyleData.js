    body: "We all want to look so good and end up going for expensive products. They work, no doubt. But there is a clause; that it is expensive doesn't mean it is perfect for your skin, you need to know what products work regardless of the cost. Now, have you ever wondered why some people look as good as they do, even without make-up or expensive wear? There are several factors, including genetics, that could cause this. However, their secret might just lie in this article. Fruits and Vegetables: As much as we might try to deny it, our skin naturally ages and ageing can be sped up by overexposure to sunlight, chemicals, and poor nutrition. Treat your skin right by consuming a lot of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants that help to protect the skin from cellular damage caused by radicals. Eat at least three portions of fruits and vegetables daily. Apples, carrots and fruits rich in Vitamin C act as antioxidants. They support the immune system, heal blemishes, and promote radiant skin. They are also needed to produce collagen. Excellent sources of Vitamin C also include Guava, Kiwi, sweet potatoes, amongst others. Water: Our skin needs moisture to stay flexible. Medical practitioners advise us to drink six to eight glasses of water daily because even mild dehydration can cause our skin to look dry and tired. If you like the option of adding lemons to your water, that is also great, as one of its functions is to prevent kidney stones. But be careful: drinking too much lemon water can damage the tooth enamel. Herbal and caffeine-free teas are excellent too. In addition, fruits like watermelon and cucumbers are also good; as they will increase the rate, your skin and body are hydrated.",

    body: "When younger we make various choices without the future in mind. Sometimes those choices bite us in our mid-life. These are some of the things one might regret when they're older. 1. Marrying the wrong person When you're young, check your motives for marrying. Don't marry to copy your peers, or for social standing or out of pressure. Marry for love and companionship, marry the right person, marry your best friend. For if you marry the wrong person or for the wrong reasons, you will have to put up with that person the rest of your life. Things might get worse between you two; then depression, physical abuse, affairs, pain, shame, court cases, bitterness will define your mid-life years all because you chose the wrong one. Things will get worse when children are involved. Make the right choice of a spouse when you are young. 2. The opportunities you did not seize When you are younger many doors will open, you will get many chances. Many young people let these opportunities go because of fear, laziness, or pride; yet well younger and with more energy is the best time to start a venture and a name for yourself. Some think the opportunities are too big for them. Take advantage of them or one day when you're older you will want to go back and grab those missed chances. 3. The bridges you burned When we are younger, we care little for relationships, what most think about is getting money and moving up the ladder of success at all cost. Many use and trample on people to progress, they take relationships for granted, messing up bonds, sleeping with people for personal gain. But these bad actions will catch up with you ahead. When you will realize how empty life is without love and friends. When you will have success but no one around you or no one to trust you. 4. The child you aborted You are a young lady, you get pregnant and you are scared. You take the aborting option quickly thinking of that moment then. But when you are much older, you will look back and wish you kept that baby. When you will be rich and successful you will wish that child you gave up on would be around to enjoy the fruits of your hard work. Being a single mother doesn't mean you can't make it in life or you can't find a man in future.d by choice",

    body: "Food is life. It's hard to imagine living without a delicious taste lingering in your mouth after consuming a steaming hot plate of jollof rice, or a mountain of strong eba with heavily garnished egusi soup. Growing up, we were introduced to several food combinations and got used to them. We tend to see these combinations as the norm and consider them palatable. For example, we all know rice and beans are soulmates, and yam and egg are inseparable twins. However, it's important for you to, once in a while, try new food combinations. In this article, we push you towards taking a risk by suggesting weird food combinations you can try out. Bread and Egusi This unusual combo is everything. All our lives, we believed that egusi only goes well with swallowed food like Amala and Semo. Sorry to break the bad news, but we have been told a big lie. Egusi tastes better with bread, particularly soft bread. Still, having doubts about this combo? A piece of bread dipped in egusi soup would change your mind. 5 Weird Food Combinations To Try Out 5 Weird Food Combinations To Try Out Sardine and yam The few features sardine cans have exhibited over the years are their increasing outrageous prices and versatility. The latter implies it goes well with many food items. So, if you can eat yams and fish sauce with groundnut oil, then eating this combo shouldn't be different. Remember, bread and sardines are an overrated combo. Spice things up by substituting boring bread with yam. 5 Weird Food Combinations To Try Out Jollof Spaghetti and palm oil beans Compared to the other items on our list, this combo isn't too weird. So, if you have yet to try it out, you are missing out on pure, delicious goodness. This combo has a similar taste to the clichéd rice and beans combo. Spaghetti is often regarded as an immediate relative of rice, so eating it with beans is highly advised. Bread, oats, and beans 5 Weird Food Combinations To Try Out When people say, 'the more the merrier,' this combo best explains it. Life is too short for you not to enjoy the various meals that come with it. Though bread and beans is a regular combo, you can add a bowl of oats to the mix just to give your tongue that extra 'hmmm' it deserves.",

    body: "Lol, I call it sad because life is too short not to know food rules! Well, healthy foods tho and not just water, nuts, yikes.. what is that? Between pre-show liquid diets and regimes filled with lean protein and buckwheat shakes, Victoria's Secret models are famous for their strict eating habits. And now, Australian Victoria Secret model, Bridget Malcolm, has revealed that her own Angel physique doesn't come without some sacrifice. In a post published on the 25-year-old model's blog on Monday, Bridget detailed her eating habits. These include carrying cherry tomatoes in her bag, drinking up to five litres of water a day and going for 14 hours without food overnight. According to Bridget - who has also modelled for swimwear brand, Seafolly - while there is no such thing as a typical daily diet, she will make sure she starts her day with a chocolate-flavoured vegan meal replacement shake. 'With 20 grams of protein it helps me to feel full first thing,' she wrote. If the model is at home, she said she'll blend it 'with a banana and some almond milk, but if I am travelling I just mix it with water and eat it with a spoon'. Bridget then leaves a certain amount of time before she eats. As she is not a breakfast person, she makes sure she consumes two litres of water first thing: 'This habit took a bit of training - but it is the best! I aim for around one to one and a half [four to five litres] gallons of water a day, and if I hit two litres first thing, it puts me on track for the day,' she said. For the rest of the day, Bridget said she will space out her meals by three to four hours - making sure that in 'every meal, the hero is vegetables'. 'I hate our society's obsession with protein - if we were as obsessed with hitting our fibre needs, I believe the diseases of affluence would be greatly reduced,' she said - adding that obesity and protein consumption are intricately linked. Bridget did add, however, that with every meal she will make sure she has a serving of tofu or beans. Lastly, when it comes to snacks - the 25-year-old swears by tomatoes.'I always carry cherry tomatoes with me. If I am hungry and food is far away, or flying, or in a non-vegan friendly environment, I make sure I have some tomatoes to eat,' she wrote.",

    body: "There are days when you look around your home, particularly the walls, and can't help but feel like something is missing. Though it's hard to identify, deep down you know that without that item, everywhere feels and looks empty. That item is what we call an 'artwork.' Due to the numerous benefits they offer, artworks are essential in every home. One could argue that owning artwork is just as important as owning a furniture set. However, it comes as a surprise when people fail to acknowledge the importance of having a masterpiece by an artist on their walls or in a corner of their living room. In this article, we will ART-SENSITIZE you by listing five advantages of having artwork in your home. Beautification- Do we need to explain further? It's no secret that artists are talented individuals who express themselves through beautiful paintings and sculptures. So, what better way to share in the enchanting goodness they unleash on the world than by owning their masterpieces? Do you require proof? Try hanging a painting on your wall to see how much more beautiful it makes your walls look, or place a sculpture on a stool in your room to be surprised at how much the attractiveness of the stool increases by a hundred percent.Artwork symbolizes class and taste. Fun Fact: Art is very expensive. Recently, we have seen auctions selling off artworks at prices that would make our jaws drop. Art is considered valuable, and rich people are willing to bid any price just to get their hands on a fascinating work created by an artist. Imagine someone walks into your house and sees a beautiful painting on your wall. The person would immediately assume you are rich, even if Sapa is choking you. In addition to your being perceived to be an upper-class member, the person would appreciate your taste level in selecting such artwork. Support and promotion. We rise by lifting each other. As a society, we must help each other grow. One of the best ways to do this is by supporting artists and buying their pieces. To be sincere, many artists are underappreciated. Buying their artworks is your way of telling them that the time, creativity, and resources that went into creating a piece aren't in vain. Inspiration- A painting speaks louder than words. Something is fascinating about art that makes it relatable and very encouraging. Staring at an artwork sometimes allows you to see the world from a different perspective and be inspired to make a difference.",

    body: "Toxic environments in the workplace are more popular, and dealing with horrible bosses can be likened to walking on hot stones every day. Since you spend most of your time at work, walking on eggshells around your office and boss could have a more devastating impact on your mental health than you think. As these bosses are in complete control of your professional life, it is virtually impossible to avoid them, which allows for feelings of anxiety, fear and entrapment. And in many cases, resigning or leaving said organization might not be an option. So, how do you deal with working for these toxic bosses while trying to avoid a confrontation? Here are some great tips for dealing with toxic bosses every day: Ask questions: When dealing with a toxic boss, it's better to seek clarity than make assumptions. While there's a given that you'll most likely be yelled at for asking the right questions, you'd also have to deal with them yelling at you for not doing things their way or making a mistake off your assumption. And since there's no winning in this case, it's better to ask any questions you might have or seek clarity on confusion. Communication is definitely key to a better working relationship and also doubles as a great boost to your emotional intelligence. Do your job: While trying to keep your head down and stay out of trouble, this shouldn't stop you from getting your own done. So don't just do your work, do it well; chances are if you get your work done well and in time, there's much less to yell at and fewer allegations to throw around. Doing your job well also makes you even less of a target. ",

    body: "Being 30 means you ought to have got it figured out. While everyone seems to be on a 30 UNDER 30 list, making waves and history, the only waves you are seemingly making are to your hair and diet, or at a family function for being nowhere near on the path to fulfilment thereof. When you turned 25, you had hopes and dreams, aspirations and a drive, the will to do and break ceilings - concrete and glass, you knew that you could outrun Usain, then reality sets in and the one major life-changing thing you can't wait to do is have a seat. Most people are either lucky and have it all together at 30 while some just have to wait their turn. But most times, it is hard to tell a 30-year-old who actually has not achieved anything other than just living and being a decent human that 'It will get better' because it definitely will. But they do not really want to hear that. A part of them knows it will get better. Many pray for it and keep the faith and it is that faith that keeps them sane most of the time. But they also need to know that it is okay to break down. It is acceptable too! So, while every one of your peers or your younger siblings mates even have husbands and wives of their own, children, businesses, articles written about them, books they have published become Lagos Times Best Sellers, here is what you who is 30, Single and Not Thriving YET can and should do. SCHEDULE PITY PARTIES This is the only way you can thrive; when you allow yourself to feel all the emotions. It would work better if you make an appointment, schedule it in your calendar as such 'I gotta cry at 11:44 daily or weekly for just 30 minutes'. You can have this twice daily if you like, but it is a lot healthier if it progresses from twice a day to twice a week, then twice a month to only when you feel overwhelmed. Then you know you are making real-life progress and indeed thriving.",

On the days when you are not nervous or panicking about meeting up a deadline at work, you worry about catering to the needs of a family member. After performing all these activities, you face a sudden realisation; while you took care of things at work and home, you forgot to take care of an important person; yourself. Now, this is where self-care comes in. What is self-care? Simply put, it's taking care of yourself. Self-care is when you make a deliberate effort into promoting your physical and emotional health.

Nigerian cuisines typically involve the use of spices and herbs with palm oil or groundnut oil to make varieties of deliciously flavoured foods, often spiced with chilli peppers. However, there are some of our mouth-watering Nigerian foods that actually have foreign origins. 1. Jollof Rice -All Nigerians are probably very familiar with the 'Jollof wars' by now and though which country's Jollof rice is the best remains a topic of passionate debate, there is one interesting fact about Jollof rice that might be unknown by many - Jollof rice is actually of foreign origin. The origins of Jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof empire. 2. Fried Rice- This probably wouldn't come as a shock to many but Fried rice is another food with foreign origin that has been adopted by Nigerians to become one of the popular Nigerian cuisines. The exact origins of fried rice has actually been lost to history but it is believed to be of Chinese origin, invented sometime within the Sui Dynasty (589 - 618 AD), in the city of Yangzhou in the eastern Jiangsu province. 3. Coconut Rice- Over time, this dish has become a beloved dish of many seeking something different from the conventional white rice. Coconut rice is typically prepared by soaking white rice in coconut milk or cooking it with coconut flakes. Though coconut rice is found in many cultures of the world, it is believed to have its origins in the South Asia, Southeast Asia and Latin America regions.",
