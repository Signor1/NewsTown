Most of us might have passed through some related situations like this whereby you've almost spend your last card on a girlfriend and she no wan give you puna chop. In this kind situation, a lot of different contemplations will just be flying over your head like 'Abi this girl is cheating ni?', you will just be tossing different type of rhetorical question to yourself.",

    body: "The Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) are under the criminal investigative arm of the Nigerian police force. It was designed as a special unit within the Nigerian Police Force to clamp down aggressively on robberies and related criminal activities in the society. The campaign to End SARS has been ongoing for the past few months because of their abuse of power... They target young Nigerians, basically anyone that looks good and drives a car is a target. They have been harassing young men & women for the way they look, the way they dress, for using an expensive phone, driving expensive cars, they have even shot at innocent people and demanded money from people illegally to be released. Our youths have been brutalized and beaten by SARS and taken to unknown destinations, we've even heard two or more cases of some these detained suspects dying in their custody. For more than four months social media has been buzzing with stories of indiscriminate arrests, and murder by SARS operatives. The hashtag #ENDSARS has a lot of stories to tell, that will leave you in shock and awe. Although the Nigeria Police Force has created a new hashtag in reaction to the #EndSARS movement which followed series of complaints shared online by Nigerian youths on alleged harassment, assault by the Special Anti-robbery squad, SARS, there has not been much changes. What's your take on the issue. Should SARS be ended? Yes or No?",

    body: "Just got hold of this Article from The Infoscope - FUTO Facebook Page, and after reading, I decided to share. Hope to enlighten you guys on this. If you have been to a sports viewing center or have been to a sports betting shop, you will definitely agree with me that sports betting is gradually eating deep into the minds of our youth that they are beginning to see it as normal. This trend of 'I want to make quick money' has deluded most of our youths and even married men into ostentatious spending. A lot have been said in a bid to curb this ugly trend but it seems we have reached the point of 'no return' However, it won't deter me from lending my own voice to help to condemn this glorified form of stealing. I will be writing not as an egoist but based on the comments I have received so far on sports betting and also based on personal observations citing some few examples. Recently, while going through the threads of Nairaland, I came across a topic titled 'Is sports betting a sin?', and people argued on it but dear reader, do you think sports betting is a sin? I will start by giving you hint on what sports betting is all about. Sports betting can be described as an activity of predicting sports results usually played with money and you will expect a 'huge' sum of money if your predictions finally work. You will predict which team will win or draw in a match and each match fixture usually carries its own odds and the higher the odds, the higher chances of winning huge sum of money. There are various forms of sports betting like the type played at pools, 'Baba Ijebu' but I'm concerned with online sports betting. Online sports betting can be done on various platforms like bet9ja, Nairabet, Nairastake, surebet247, bet365naija, 9japredict, bet2win, 360bet, 1960bet etc. but the most popular among them are bet9ja(owned by KC Gaming networks ltd) and Nairabet(Owned Get Altitude Nigeria Ltd) and each them have various outlets in Nigeria. They have many exciting list of sports to bet on which include soccer, tennis, basketball, volleyball, motor sports, horse/dog racing, rugby, handball, American football etc. but the most popular among Nigerian youths is soccer betting and these sports are available from teams all over the world. Soccer bets can be played on premier league, Champions league, bundesliga, la-liga, international and local matches etc. Bet type includes: head to head, over/under, odd/even, correct score, goal difference, winning tam etc.",

I just sat down today and was thinking what the perfect punishment these rapists truly deserve because I doubt if the country is doing enough to bring justice to this people. I read the story of how a family got the news of their Daughter being Raped but have to ignore because they wanted to keep it as a family secret. How the hell could they do that? Now, here is our Question for you all..If You Had A Chance To Bring Justice/Punish Rapists, What Would That Be? ➧ Jail sentence for life? ➧ Death by Hanging? ➧ Cement & Water mixed together and asking the Rapist to drink it? ➧ Breaking broom in the Rapist D!ck? ➧ Castration? ➧ Forgiveness? What would the Punishment be?",

    body: "Latest governance poll results released by NOIPolls, an opinion research agency founded by former Minister of Finance, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, says 70 per cent of Nigerians surveyed approve President Muhammadu Buhari's job performance over the past one month. Nigerians in this category mentioned reasons such as security has improved (20 percent), he has good intentions (16 percent), and stability of electricity (15 percent) among others. While on the other hand only 12 percent of respondents disapproved of his performance over 30 days attributing it to reasons such as; nothing has changed yet and it is too early to evaluate. NOI Polls works in partnership with a United States-based The Gallup Poll to conduct periodic opinion polls and studies on various socio-economic and political issues in Nigeria. The assessment poll, according to a statement on the agency's website on Wednesday, was conducted to gauge the opinions of Nigerians regarding the approval rating of the President's first 30 days in office and the current state of power supply in the country. The poll also revealed that: *.The President recorded 87 per cent approval rating in the North-East, North-West and North-Central zones *.While the South-East zone accounted for the greatest percentage of respondents who disapproved of the President's performance. *.The South-South zone accounted for the largest fraction of respondents who were neutral, with 26 per cent.The poll seems to follow the pattern of election results of Buhari in the 2015 general election. Buhari, who contested the office for the fourth time, polled 15,424,921 votes against former President Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party to clinch the presidential seat. Buhari won the election in 16 northern states and five south-western states, while Jonathan won the poll in three northern states, the FCT and 12 South-South and South-East states. This result represents the first rating for President Muhammadu Buhari as President of the Federal Republic.",
